First of all, in order to not harm any user's feelings, all users were rejected while creating this model. 
I felt the need to design this algorithm due to a problem I observed on the platform. 
Some users use  for advertising and commercial purposes, which is against  policy.
My approach while designing this model was as a business owner, thinking about how to generate more revenue by following the trend of the company. 
In my opinion, these users being on Tinder is not a problem, but if they are using it for commercial purposes, then I should also get my share of the profit. 
Therefore, according to my model, these users will be banned from the system if they are not premium subscribers, 
but they can stay in the system if they are premium subscribers.
